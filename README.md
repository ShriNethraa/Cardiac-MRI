# Cardiac MRI Image Analysis

## Objective: 
To analyze cardiac MRI images by loading and visualizing MRI data stored in MATLAB files, 
creating visual representations through slices and montages, and performing histogram analysis 
on pixel intensities.

## Process:
**1. Data Loading:** Loaded the MRI image data from MATLAB files for analysis.

**2. Image Visualization:** Visualized the MRI data slices along different dimensions for better understanding.

**3. Montage Creation:** Created montages for a specified axis to provide a comprehensive view of the images.

**4. Histogram Analysis:** Conducted histogram analysis on pixel intensities to understand image characteristics and distribution.

## Result: 
The analysis enabled efficient visualization of cardiac MRI images, helping to examine 
the data in multiple dimensions. The histogram analysis provided insights into the distribution of 
pixel intensities, aiding in the interpretation of the MRI scans for potential medical evaluations.
